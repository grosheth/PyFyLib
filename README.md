# PyFyLib
Python Module that uses spotipy to interact with the Spotify API

This module is going to be used in a discord bot project.

The goal is to get tracks, albums, artists and covers only by passing a string. (track/album/artist)

This is still uncertain, but the module may also be used to play songs.
